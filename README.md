Real-world Object Recognition via Smartphone

## Model training and evaluation

The model employed in this project is MobileNet with SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector).

This choice was made due to MobileNet's relatively small size and fast performance that
is designed for a Smartphone.

SSD was selected due to the requirement of recognizing and tracking multiple objects'
locations during a detection.

## Step 1: Install TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

## Step 2: Download a pre-trained model from TensorFlow's official repository
##         OR
##         Train a model from scratch using TF-Slim on a image dataset such as ImageNet
